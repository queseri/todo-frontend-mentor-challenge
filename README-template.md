## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

This was my first time using the `drag and drop` feature. I used the `react beautify dnd` , with the help of the following notes and video from freeCodeCamp. [How to Add Drag and Drop in React with React Beautiful DnD](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/)
Here are a brief notes on the installation and implementation

1. install `react-beautiful-dnd`  using npm `npm i react-beautiful-dnd`
2. import the modules to use at the top of the file that needs the drag and drop feature `import { DragDropContext, Droppable } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';`
3. Here is a code snippet of where i used it from the `Main.js` file:
```js
     <DragDropContext onDragEnd={handleOnDragEnd}>
        <Droppable droppableId='tasks'>
          {(provided) => (
            <ul className='todo-list'
              {...provided.droppableProps}
              ref={provided.innerRef}>
              {taskList}
              {provided.placeholder}
            </ul>
          )}
          </Droppable>
      </DragDropContext>          

```
4. `taskList` is an array of the todos, which is in another file, the `Todo.js` file. The `Draggable`  library has to be imported as follows `import { Draggable } from 'react-beautiful-dnd';`. 

```js
<Draggable key={props.id} draggableId={props.id} index={props.index}>
            {(provided) => (
                <li className='todo'
                    {...provided.draggableProps}
                    {...provided.dragHandleProps}
                    ref={provided.innerRef} >
                    {isEditing ? editingTemplate : viewTemplate}
                </li>
            )}
   </Draggable>

```
5.  Back to the Main.js file, the following function must be added to wire the drag and drop feature

```js
function handleOnDragEnd(result) {
        if (!result.destination) return
        const items = Array.from(tasks)      
        const [reorderedItems] = items.splice(result.source.index, 1)
        items.splice(result.destination.index, 0, reorderedItems)       
        setTasks(items)
  }
```

DefinitelyTyped icon, indicating that this package has TypeScript declarations provided by the separate @types/react-beautiful-dnd package
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
